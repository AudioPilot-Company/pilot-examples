<!-- 
recordId: 
    The record you are trying to access

userToken:
    The token you are providing to us. We validate it with the endpoint you provided.
    If you have not provided an authorization endpoint this token will be the externalUserId.
    This is the value you implemented while uploading a script.

companyToken:
    If you do not know what your company token is you can regenerate it with the documenation.
    This is under the company section of the pilot integration document.
    Pilot Ops also provides this information as well under settings.
